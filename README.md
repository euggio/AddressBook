# Address Book
<h3>A simple address book that holds French contacts, who are distinguished as acquaintances, family members, and friends</h3>
<p>This address book allows the user to add, find, modify, display, and remove contacts.</p>
<p>Contacts' details can be modified once a search has been initiated. On display, contacts can be sorted by last name, by postal code, and also by contact type.</p>   
<p>The address book uses simple Java code and object-oriented programming, inheritance, interface, exception, generic programming, and collections framework in their very basic level.</p>  
<p>This simple project has been developed during my bootcamp training at the AFPA school, 6-8 Rue Georges et Ma√Ø Politzer, 75012 PARIS.</p>
