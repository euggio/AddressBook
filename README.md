# Address Book
<h3>A simple address book that holds French contacts or contacts with a French address and a French landline/mobile phone number</h3>
<p>In this specific address book, acceptable data are first name, last name, birthdate, street number, street number suffix, street name, street name suffix, postal code, city email, landline phone number, and mobile phone number. Family members may have all these data. However, birthdate and mobile phone are not applicable to acquaintances, whereas only birthdate is not applicable to friends. Above all, data, such as first name, last name, and landline phone, are mandatory for all contacts whosoever.</p>
<p>Contacts are distinguished as acquaintances, family members, and friends. However, this distinction does not matter when compared to each other.</p>
<p>This address book prompts the user in French to add, find, modify, display, and remove contacts.</p>
<p>Contacts' details can be modified once a search has been initiated. On display, contacts can be sorted by last name, by postal code, and also by contact type.</p>   
<p>The address book uses simple Java code and object-oriented programming, inheritance, interface, exception, generic programming, and collections framework in their very basic level.</p>  
<p>This simple project has been developed during my bootcamp training at the AFPA school, 6-8 Rue Georges et Ma√Ø Politzer, 75012 PARIS.</p>
