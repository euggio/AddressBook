# Address Book
<h3>A simple address book that holds French contacts</h3>
<p>This address book allows the user to add, find, modify, and remove contacts.</p>
<p>It uses simple Java code and object-oriented programming, inheritance, interface, exception, generic programming, and collections framework in their very basic level.</p>  
<p>This simple project has been produced during my bootcamp session in the AFPA school, located at 6-8 Rue Georges et Ma√Ø Politzer, 75012 PARIS.</p>
